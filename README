BACKSTORY

Daring escape! The rebellion's base on Hoth has been compromised and is in full evacuation. You must hold off the Empire's
waves of fighters and bombers long enough for the rebels to escape safely. You're the best ace pilot that is up to the task.
Will you ensure the rebellion lives to fight another day or will the dark grasps of the Empire spread throughout the galaxy?


CONTROLS AND GAMEPLAY

The player can be controlled using WASD or Arrow Keys. SPACE is the shoot button.

In order to win the game the player must survive 25 waves of fighters and bombers trying to make their way to the base on the
planet's surface. If a fighter makes it through, the base health will decrease by 1. If a bomber makes it through, the base
will lose 2 health. If the base is reduced to 0, the game will end in a loss. Similarly, if the player loses their health,
the game will be over as well. Throughout the game, a Repair power up will occasionally spawn which will restore player health.
If a player gets this power up while on full health, the ship's shields will activate granting an additional layer of protection.
